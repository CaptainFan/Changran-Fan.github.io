I am currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Pittsburgh and expect to complete my PhD degree in Business Administration (Information Systems & Technology Management) by May 2024.

My research interests lie at the confluence of emerging technologies, firm-level and societal-level shocks, and the ensuing digital transformation. I examine the effects of technology adoption by studying the operational configurations in which the technologies are deployed and model the resulting business value calculus using econometric and machine learning methods.
